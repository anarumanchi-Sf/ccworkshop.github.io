# ACB Workshop (GitHub Pages)

A minimal GitHub Pages site using **Jekyll** with the **just-the-docs** theme.

## Local edits (optional)
You can edit directly on GitHub, or clone locally and push.

## Publish
1. Create a repo and push these files.
2. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, set **Build and deployment** to **Deploy from a branch**, choose `main` and `/ (root)`.
3. Wait for Pages to build. Your site will appear at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` (or `https://<user>.github.io/` if the repo is named `<user>.github.io`).

## Customize
- Update `_config.yml` (title, description, links).
- Add pages (`.md`) and folders as needed.
- Add images to `assets/img` and reference them as `/assets/img/...`.
